## 1. Historical Review
Chad has long been at the center of geopolitical tensions, with elections often marred by disputes and instability. The May 2024 election saw Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno win provisionally with 61.03%, but opposition candidates contested the result, echoing historical patterns of political instability. Security challenges persist with ongoing conflicts in border regions and volatile governance structures.

## 2. Current Assessment
Presently, Chad remains politically fragile. Disputed election outcomes have heightened tensions, and the potential for unrest is elevated. Security conflicts continue, particularly in peripheral regions. Climate-related vulnerabilities, while less discussed in the election context, pose growing risks to agricultural productivity and rural livelihoods, exacerbating socio-economic challenges.

## 3. Forecast
Without significant reforms, Chad is likely to face continued political disputes and localized security conflicts. Climate risks are expected to intensify, potentially leading to migration pressures and increased competition over natural resources. Investment conditions will remain uncertain in the short term, although stabilization efforts or external mediation could improve outlook mid-term.

## 4. Investment Recommendations
- **Focus on essential services and resilient sectors** such as telecommunications and logistics which are critical in fragile contexts.
- **Avoid direct exposure to politically sensitive sectors** until governance stabilizes.
- **Engage in blended finance or donor-backed investment mechanisms** to mitigate risks.
- **Monitor political developments closely**, especially regarding Constitutional Council rulings and opposition reactions.

## 5. Climate Investment Opportunities
- **Climate-resilient agriculture**, particularly drought-resistant crops and irrigation systems.
- **Renewable energy projects**, given Chadâ€™s high solar potential and limited grid penetration.
- **Water management and infrastructure**, to reduce the vulnerability of rural populations to climate shocks.
