Historical Review,"Past risks included chronic political instability, frequent local security conflicts, and repeated exposure to climate shocks such as drought and flood cycles. Historical investments were impeded by governance challenges and underdeveloped infrastructure."
Current Assessment,"Today, political instability remains a concern with occasional unrest, particularly in rural and conflict-sensitive areas. Security conflicts are localized but persistent. Investment interest exists, but risk appetite is limited. Climate risks are increasing with shifting weather patterns and water stress."
Forecast,"Political volatility and security issues are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Climate risks will further intensify, driving demand for resilience-oriented investments. Growth potential exists in targeted climate-smart sectors but requires careful risk management."
Investment Recommendations,"Adopt risk mitigation strategies including insurance, local partnerships, and phased investment approaches. Focus on essential infrastructure, blended finance mechanisms, and targeted projects with clear resilience benefits."
Climate Investment Opportunities,"Key opportunities lie in renewable energy (solar and mini-grid solutions), climate-resilient agriculture, water management infrastructure, and ecosystem restoration projects particularly in lower-conflict zones."
